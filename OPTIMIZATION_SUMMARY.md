# OCR Processing Optimization Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Optimized Base Settings
- **Batch Size**: Increased from 5 â†’ 10 files per batch
- **Batch Delay**: Reduced from 10s â†’ 3s between batches  
- **Request Delay**: Reduced from 2s â†’ 500ms between individual requests
- **Concurrency**: Increased from 1 â†’ 3 concurrent file processing

### 2. Dynamic Rate Adjustment System
Added intelligent scaling that automatically adjusts processing parameters based on success rates:

- **Scale Up**: When success rate > 95%, increase batch size and reduce delays
- **Scale Down**: When success rate < 80%, decrease batch size and increase delays
- **Monitoring**: Evaluates performance every 5 batches
- **Safety Limits**: 
  - Min batch size: 3 files
  - Max batch size: 20 files
  - Min delay: 1s
  - Max delay: 15s

### 3. Concurrent Processing
- Files within each batch now process concurrently (up to 3 at once)
- Maintains rate limiting while improving throughput
- Better utilization of API capacity

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Speed Increases
- **Conservative estimate**: 3-5x faster processing
- **Old settings**: ~5 files every 25+ seconds = ~12 files/minute
- **New settings**: ~10 files every 8+ seconds = ~75 files/minute (theoretical max)

### Smart Adaptation
- System starts aggressively and scales back if rate limits are hit
- Learns optimal settings for your specific API usage patterns
- Automatically finds the sweet spot between speed and reliability

## Safety Features

### Rate Limit Protection
- Enhanced error detection for rate limit responses
- Exponential backoff on failures  
- Dynamic adjustment prevents sustained rate limit violations

### Monitoring & Feedback
- Real-time success rate tracking
- Automatic parameter adjustment logging
- Performance improvement statistics in summary

## Usage

The system now automatically optimizes itself. No manual configuration needed:

```bash
# Normal processing with auto-optimization
node src/batch-process.js

# Test mode (processes first 3 files)
node src/batch-process.js --test
```

## Configuration

You can disable dynamic adjustment in `src/config.js` if needed:

```javascript
dynamicRateAdjustment: {
  enabled: false,  // Set to false to disable
  // ... other settings
}
```

## Monitoring Output

Watch for these new log messages:
- `ðŸ§  Dynamic rate adjustment enabled`
- `ðŸ”„ Dynamic adjustment N: Scaling UP/DOWN`
- `ðŸ§  Dynamic Rate Adjustment Stats` in final summary

The system will show you exactly how it's optimizing your processing speed!
